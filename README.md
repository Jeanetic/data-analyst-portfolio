## About

My journey into data analytics began unexpectedly in the recruitment industry, where, over two years, I helped companies find the right talent. But as I worked, I noticed a recurring theme—the power of data. The ability to make informed decisions based on solid data fascinated me, and I became increasingly curious about how I could uncover insights and visualize them to drive credible decisions and strategies.
Driven by this curiosity, I decided to dive deep into the world of data analysis. I immersed myself in courses and earned certifications to build my skills. Through practical projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience in exploratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis. Tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly), SQL, Power BI, and Tableau have become my go-to resources for transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
In my free time, I delve into articles on Medium to expand my knowledge or engage in personal data projects to improve other data techniques. I am passionate about discovering new insights and solving complex problems with data.
Now, I'm eager to take my skills to the next level. I'm seeking opportunities to continue learning, growing, and pushing the boundaries of data analysis. My goal is to contribute valuable insights that drive business success and make a real impact.
